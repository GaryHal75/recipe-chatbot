3. Coat the baking sheet with cooking spray. Lightly sprinkle fish fillets with chili powder and
place on the baking pan.
4. Place in the oven about 6 inches from the broiler and cook for approximately 3 to 4
minutes, or until fish is fully cooked. You will know the fish is done when it "flakes" or pulls
apart easily when separated with a fork.
5. Lightly fry tortillas on an oiled griddle or skillet, or heat tortillas in the microwave oven for
just a few seconds until softened and hot.
6. Fill tortilla with fish, cabbage, onion, and cilantro and fold in half. Serve with salsa and citrus
slices, if desired.
