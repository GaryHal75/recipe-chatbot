Directions
1. Wash hands with soap and water.

until tender or “al dente,” approximately 5 to 7 minutes; drain and set aside.
3. Heat a non-stick wok or pan over high heat. Add 1/2 tablespoon oil, swirling to coat the
pan, add noodles and pan-fry until noodles are golden, about 7 to 10 minutes. Remove
noodles from wok.
4. Add remaining 1/2 tablespoon oil to wok, add vegetables, and stir-fry until just cooked,
about 5 to 7 minutes.
5. Return noodles to the wok, add salt, sugar and soy sauce.
