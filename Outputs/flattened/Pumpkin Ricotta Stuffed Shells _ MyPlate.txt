DIRECTIONS:
Wash hands with soap and water.
Preheat oven to 350 Â°F.
Cook pasta shells according to package directions. Drain and place each on a baking sheet to cool.
In a medium bowl, stir together ricotta, pumpkin, spices, and all but 1 tablespoon of the cheese. Reserve the 1 tablespoon cheese for topping.
Spread pasta sauce in the bottom of a baking dish that holds all the shells in a single layer. Fill each shell with about 3 tablespoons of pumpkin mixture and place shells close together on top of the sauce.
Cover pan with foil and bake for 30 minutes. Remove foil, sprinkle with remaining cheese, and bake for 15 minutes more. Notes Freeze unused pumpkin and add to soup, chili or pancake recipes. https://www.myplate.gov/recipes/pumpkin-ricotta-stuffed-shells 2/6
